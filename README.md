# Incidence, prevalence and characterisation of patients with cardiac arrest

## Background
Cardiac arrest is a life-threatening event that occurs when the heart suddenly stops beating, often due to underlying cardiovascular conditions such as coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, and heart failure. Lifestyle factors, including smoking, poor diet, lack of exercise, and excessive alcohol consumption, can increase the risk of cardiac arrest by contributing to heart disease and other related conditions.

## Study Design
Cohort study

## Population
All people in the database from 2012 to end of data capture.

## Outcome of Interest
Cardiac arrest.

## Variables
Demographic information such as age and sex, medicine use, and diagnoses of comorbidities and possible indications will be identified to characterise people with cardiac arrests.  

## Analyses
1. Characterisation of people with cardiac arrest.
- Age groups: under 50 and 50+.
- Large scale characteristation of conditions and drugs for the following time periods: (-365, -31), (-30, -1), (0,0), (1, 30), (31, 365)
2. Estimation of incidence and prevalence of cardiac arrests, stratified by age and sex.
  - Monthly, annual and overall incidence.
  - Two age groups - under 50 and 50+.
